<h1 id="sassdocspringkittheme">SassDoc SpringKit Theme</h1>

<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc">SassDoc</a>&#8217;s default theme which means this is the theme that will be used when running SassDoc without a custom theme.</p>

<p>This theme uses <a href="https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon">Themeleon</a> as a theme engine, and <a href="https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon-swig">themeleon-swig</a> as a template engine, directly plugged into Themeleon.</p>

<p>Because this is likely to be the most used theme of all, it is not as simple as a theme can get. For instance, there is quite a bit of logic in both <code>index.js</code> and the Swig templates. Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to deal with that at all.</p>

<h2 id="customisingtheview">Customising the view</h2>

<p>There are some possibilites to customise the theme&#8217;s view. Essentially what&#8217;s being displayed, what&#8217;s not, and what are the project informations to be displayed in the header and footer.</p>

<p>To learn how to customise the theme&#8217;s view, please read <a href="http://sassdoc.com/customising-the-view/">the documentation on SassDoc&#8217;s site</a>. Fear not! It&#8217;s all about creating a configuration file. No big deal.</p>
